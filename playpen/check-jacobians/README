This directory contains files that are meant to test PyLith Jacobians
for all existing materials. The 3D problems can all be run by using
the run_all_3d.sh script, and the 2D problems can be run using the
run_all_2d.sh script. There are two cases for each problem:

1.  A case where we actually solve the problem (*solve.cfg files).
2.  A case where we compute the Jacobians using snes_compare_explicit
    (*jacobian.cfg files).

The reason there are two cases is because the solutions don't converge
when computing the Jacobians (not sure why).

Note that PyLith should be compiled using the -DDEBUG_SNES_JACOBIAN
compiler flag. This will provide a view of the Jacobian (separate
from the snes_compare_explicit output), as well as checking Jacobian
symmetry and providing a solution view (which also shows constrained
DOF, etc., for determining equation numbers).
