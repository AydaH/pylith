This directory contains files that are meant to test PyLith Jacobians
for all existing materials. The 3D problems can all be run by using
the run_all_3d.sh script, and the 2D problems can be run using the
run_all_2d.sh script. There are two cases for each problem:

1.  A case where we actually solve the problem (*solve.cfg files).
2.  A case where we compute the Jacobians using snes_compare_explicit
    (*jacobian.cfg files).

The reason there are two cases is because the solutions don't converge
when computing the Jacobians (not sure why).

Note that PyLith should be compiled using the -DDEBUG_SNES_JACOBIAN
compiler flag. This will provide a view of the Jacobian (separate
from the snes_compare_explicit output), as well as checking Jacobian
symmetry and providing a solution view (which also shows constrained
DOF, etc., for determining equation numbers).

To run all tests and check the Jacobians, do:

./run_all_2d.sh
./run_all_3d.sh
check_jacobians.py > check_jacobians.log 2>&1 &

or just do:
./run_all.sh

Current results:
1.  All symmetries are as expected. The only Jacobians that are not
    symmetric are the Drucker-Prager models for non-associated flow
    and the D-P models where we allow (and create) tensile yield.
2.  Most of the PyLith Jacobians are in good agreement with the
    finite difference Jacobians from PETSc.  The exceptions are:
    a.  Drucker-Prager 2d tensile:  Maximum difference is 290%
    b.  Power-law 2d:  maximum difference is 6.3%.
    c.  Drucker-Prager 3d tensile:  Maximum difference is 520%.
    d.  Power-law 3d:  maximum difference is 6.3%.

For now, I am skipping the DP tensile cases, because I don't think
we have a consistent formulation.
For Power-law, the Jacobians are in reasonable agreement, and the
agreement is actually better than when we try alpha=1.0 (backward
difference) as opposed to our default value of 0.5.

It is probably worthwhile to try the models with and without
initial stresses, to see if this changes anything.
