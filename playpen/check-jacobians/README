This directory contains files that are meant to test PyLith Jacobians
for both Drucker-Prager and Power-law. All the problems have been run
but you can run them again by using the run_all.sh script.  There are
two cases for each problem:

1.  A case where we actually solve the problem (*solve.cfg files).
2.  A case where we compute the Jacobians using snes_compare_explicit.

The reason there are two cases is because the solutions don't converge
when computing the Jacobians (not sure why).

The results are puzzling, because the computed Jacobians appear to be
virtually identical no matter what rheology is used. For example, the
PyLith Jacobians for associated and non-associated Drucker-Prager are
identical. The PyLith Jacobians for Drucker-Prager and power-law are
identical until row 32. I can't think of any reason this would be true.

I am running this using willic3/fix-plastic-jacobian, which should be
virtually identical to master, except I have set _isJacobianSymmetric
to always be false.
